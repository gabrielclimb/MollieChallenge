# The coding challenge
The goal the assignment is to train a machine learning model of your own choice and use that model to create a prediction serving endpoint. In your notebook, you ought to demonstrate how the consuming party should query your endpoint.
 
Your focus should be more on the engineering part around building a stable and solid API endpoint to serve a model and not so much on the EDA part and model performance (but please don't forget about the DS 101 concepts). You can use any Python framework you would like and any HTTP server.
 
Please think about how you provision your API service in a production setting.
 
Attached you will find a Jupyter notebook file called challenge.ipynb, which contains sample code to load the dataset. 

We will assess the code based upon the adaption of best practices and standards according to software engineering and MLOps principles.

Most candidates spent around 4 hours on the coding assignment.
